				<h2 class="text-pc__subtitle">How the Programm works</h2>
				<p>Our Sites and Services are powered by User-generated Reviews. We encourage those who desire to share their experience regarding a software product, service or vendor to submit reviews on our Site.</p>
				<p class="text-color">You acknowledge and agree that we as the website operator are merely providing a platform for these user-generated reviews; and that all such reviews represent the opinions of the reviewers of those products, services or vendors and not those of us. From time to time, we may provide nominal incentives (such as gift cards) to encourage submission of reviews, regardless of whether the content of the review is positive or negative. We provide clear notice on our Sites when a reviewer has been offered a nominal incentive for submitting an honest review. Users may opt to post their review anonymously, but must submit sufficient information for our Quality Assurance team to verify their identity. While a reviewer may choose not to share personal information with the public, their identity is always verified by our Quality Assurance team before we permit their review to be published.</p>
				<p>When participating in our Reviews Program, you (whether a software buyer, vendor or reviewer), acknowledge and agree to adhere to our Community Guidelines. Our Community Guidelines set forth the rules of play for users, reviewers and vendors. This includes the QA process, the guidelines each review must meet and the process for flagging reviews for investigation. </p>
